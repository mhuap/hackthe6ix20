This is the README for your project. If you choose to publish a `source`
for this project, this is what will be displayed as part of the Autocode
[Source Code](/src). **The first line** will be used as the
title of the template. Otherwise, you should use it to record important
information about the project for yourself or your teammates.

## Preview
While in the Autocode Editor, you can see a small preview of your README
in the bottom right corner. Click on it to expand the preview.

## GitHub
Should you decide to publish your projects and templates to GitHub,
you can include an **Open in Autocode** button as displayed above.
This will enable anybody to fork your project in Autocode directly.
